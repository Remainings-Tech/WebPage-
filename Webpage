    <li>I love video games, and I find them very fun. I have so many favorite games that I’ve never played, but I’ve seen others' gameplay, like Resident Evil, Until Dawn, Sonic, Detroit: Become Human, Ghost of Tsushima, Spider-Man, The Quarry, and more. Without video games, the world—and media—would be completely different! </li>

<li>Back in 2012, I watched a YouTuber that created great content on a channel called Machinima. They also had their own website back then, which is now owned by Warner Bros. Machinima was a popular YouTube channel network in the mid-2000s to early 2010s, known for using video game engines to create animated content. In 2019, it was shut down and acquired by Warner Bros. after facing backlash for exploiting creators with unfair contracts and low pay, leading to many of its channels and videos being removed.My favorite series I watched back then were *The Noob Adventure*, *Sonic for Hire*, *Mob Squad*, *Battlefield Friends*, and others. My favorite Machinima channels they owned were Machinima Realm, Machinima Happy Hour, Machinima Respawn, Machinima Insider, Gaming, etc. </li>
